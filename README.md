# Metropolitan Council ActivitySim Model

## Overview

This is a model that simulates choices made by people throughout their day - if and when they go to work, school, out to eat, shopping, etc. 

This model is built in a mixture of Python 3 (ActivitySim) and Cube Voyager (Skimming and Assignment).

**Currently in Development**

## Dependencies

Anaconda 3 64 bit is required to create the environment and run Activitysim. This model also requires a licensed copy of Cube Voyager 6.4, which must be purchased separately. 

## Getting Started

1. Create an Anaconda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

2. Install the correct version of ActivitySim with `pip install activitysim==0.9.9.1`

3. Create a data subfolder and copy the input data to it

4. Run ActivitySim with the batch file `runAsim.bat`

(expect this to change as the model is developed)
