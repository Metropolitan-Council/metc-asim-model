# Metropolitan Council ActivitySim Model

This is a model that simulates choices made by people throughout their day - if and when they go to work, school, out to eat, shopping, etc. 

This model is built in a mixture of Python 3 (ActivitySim) and Cube Voyager (Skimming and Assignment).

Currently in Development.
