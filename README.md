# Metropolitan Council ActivitySim Model

This is a model that simulates choices made by people throughout their day - if and when they go to work, school, out to eat, shopping, etc. 

This model is built in a mixture of Python 3 (ActivitySim) and Cube Voyager (Skimming and Assignment).

Currently in Development.

## Getting Started

Install the correct version of ActivitySim with `pip install activitysim==0.9.7`

Create a data subfolder and copy the input data to it

Run ActivitySim with the batch file `runAsim.bat`
